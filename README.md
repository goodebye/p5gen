# p5gen - a cli for generating (and hopefully maybe eventually managing) p5.js projects

## usage

first, install the package globally (may require root privileges)
`npm install -g p5gen`
then, navigate to the directory where you'd like your new p5.js sketch to be created and type `p5gen --name [name]`
the project structure is modeled after the p5.js-editor's project structure so they should be interoperable
